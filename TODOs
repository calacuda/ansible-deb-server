TODO's:
- [x] add repo for zsh-history-substring-search
- [x] ~~add user to sudo group~~ (not doable bc I'm not SSHing in as root)
- [x] install apt packages
- [x] install git packages
- [x] update machine
- [x] configure ssh to not allow root login
- [x] bring in ZSH/Emacs/Neovim configs
- [ ] install rust (more of a long term thing)
- [ ] make a git hub bare repo to clone from for config files
- [ ] make server groups so proxmox servers ssh configs don't change
