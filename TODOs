TODO's:
- [x] add repo for zsh-history-substring-search
- [x] ~~add user to sudo group~~ (not doable bc I'm not SSHing in as root)
- [x] install apt packages
- [x] install git packages
- [x] update machine
- [x] ~~configure ssh to not allow root login?~~ (done manually, but id like to automate in in the future)
- [x] bring in ZSH/Emacs/Neovim configs
- [ ] install rust (more of a long term thing)
